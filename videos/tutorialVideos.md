# Tutorial series

-   Video series with tutorials of several core topics by example
-   Don't do shitty acting, but describe hypothetical situations.

## Keyboard centric + context menu (Basic usage):

    -   Talking with a friend: "Hey do you know what 'fungible' in NFTs actually means?"
    -   Type greater than sign
    -   Look it up in LaunchMenu. Hit command+space on Mac or windows-space on Windows to open LaunchMenu
    -   Type in your query (misspelled 'fungile')
    -   Notice how LM uses fuzzy search (mention how search system can be altered)
        -   First item is not what we want, acknowledge the mistake
    -   Move cursor down and mention keyboard controls
        -   Mention how all of these controls can be customized
    -   Press tab to open context menu:
        -   Mention how every item has a context-menu of actions specific to the item
        -   Mention how certain items have Arrows on the right, to indicate they are folders that can be stepped into
        -   Navigate to Definitions item
        -   Enter Definitions > Adjective
        -   Mention how non-folder menu items have primary actions, in this case closing LM and pasting the definition
        -   Press enter to execute a copy exit paste handler

## Search anywhere (Advanced search behavior):

    -   Describe reading this: https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-57288485, specifically "Pauline Sadler and her husband Tony own one of the flats which had previously been on the top floor." :
        -   Mention how this may be confusing to dutch people, since in dutch it's a common misconception that 'Flat' describes the building as a whole
        -   Mention how one may want to search for this word, and find the exact definition
    -   Open LM without explanation
    -   Search for `flat`
    -   Mention how flat has an overwhelming amount of definitions, and how the top ones don't seem relevant.
        -   Also mention how `page up` and `page down` can be used to scroll, however it's still to overwhelming
    -   Mention how just like in the previous example we can goto the definitions from the context menu, and how we can actually search within the apartment sub-menu to find our definition:
        -   While explaining this, perform these actions and search for `apartment`
    -   Mention how we didn't even have to step into the `noun` folder, since most menus including the definitions menu perform recursive searches.
    -   Mention that applets can define filter patterns for searches, and that the dictionary applet uses the `define:` pattern which also accepts a language argument.
        -   Mention how we could look up the dutch definition to compare the english definition to
        -   Type `define nl: flat` and show how the definition indeed differs
