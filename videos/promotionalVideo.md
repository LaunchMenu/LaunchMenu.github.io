## Script

Imagine a world where utilities are at your fingertips, and you could search both the internet and your computer through 1 slick interface. A world where any information is a few keystrokes away helping you stay in your flow, and keeping you in the zone. This is our vision for LaunchMenu.

LaunchMenu is a free, cross-platform utility application, which is extensible through 3rd party applets. Unlike other search-based programs, LaunchMenu is designed with fully fledged applications in mind. This ensures that you never have to leave LaunchMenu to get the job done.

There are multiple reasons why this is beneficial.

-   LaunchMenu's keyboard-centric design helps you get the job done quickly without wasting time swapping between the mouse and keyboard.
-   LaunchMenu has a flexible actions system, which packs a lot of functionality into each menu item. These actions can even be applied to multiple items simultaneously.
-   All menus in LaunchMenu are searchable allowing you to quickly jump to where you need to be.

## Script 2

Imagine a world where utilities are at your fingertips [closeup of typing at keyboard](), and you could search both the internet and your computer through 1 slick interface [Some disconnected graph with various data sources at the leaves](). A world where any information is a few keystrokes away helping you stay in your flow, and keeping you in the zone [draw lines in from nodes in graph to the user bubble with various shots, zooming out to show full graph](). This is our vision for LaunchMenu [blurred background, and send launchmenu title + icon onto screen]().

LaunchMenu is a free, cross-platform utility application, which is extensible through 3rd party applets [Windows, Mac, Linux icons appearing](). Unlike other search-based programs, LaunchMenu is designed with fully fledged applications in mind. This ensures that you never have to leave LaunchMenu to get the job done. [open lm and zoom into it so it takes up most of the video but not all, show searching for note, and edit it]()

## Shots to make

### Typing at keyboard

Record self and my nice blue keyboard, after having cleaned desk

### Graph

Video of graph gradually getting connected zooming out toward user icon.

Some node options:

-   Calendar
-   Email
-   Weather (rainy cloud)
-   LM Applet icons
-   people icon
-   chat icon
-   Task icon
-   AI icon
-   Cloud data icon

-   Not sure about specific social media icons

### LM title screen

Blur out the background network

Logo + Title "LaunchMenu"

### LM usage story

-   Search for notes applet
-   Open notes, and see there are already notes in different categories
-   Navigate to creating a new note
-   Enter name of note
-   Start editing note in Markdown format
-   Create category
-   Open context menu and new and old note to created category
-   Select new note
-   Open context menu
-   Search for syntax
-   Change syntax to markdown
-   Continue doing stuff for a bit so we can blur out (e.g. search for efficinecy in the dictionary)

### LM outro screen

# Promotional showcase for developers

-   LaunchMenu is great for developers
-   Current primarily attractive for developers while it's in beta
-   LaunchMenu is built on popular web technologies; TypeScript, electron, and React
-   LaunchMenu requires applets to be useful similar to how Operating systems require programs.
-   Applications can be made by 3rd parties and we supply a proper API for it.
-   The API can be used to interface with LaunchMenu while also providing building blocks which can be used to make applets.
-   LaunchMenu applets need to adhere to the applet interface. For many developers the provided building blocks suffice to accomplish this, however some developers might prefer to create them for themselves. As an analogy: The only requirement for being at a university/school is that you can pass the test. For many students the provided material suffices, however some students might prefer other sources, e.g. videos.
-   Ultimately LaunchMenu is simple to get started with, but flexible enough to make your wildest dreams come true!
-   LaunchMenu also provides useful developer features like live-reloading and TSDoc for all functions
-   Look how simple it is to make an applet!
-   But that's just a theory, a LM theory! Thanks for launching

  As an analogy: The only requirement for being at a university/school is that you can pass the test. For many students the provided material suffices, however some students might prefer other sources, e.g. videos. In a similar way, LaunchMenu applets need to adhere to the applet interface. For many developers the provided building blocks suffice, however some developers might prefer to create them for themselves.

  Building blocks are built in a composable way in order to simplify the construction of larger custom blocks.

  LaunchMenu is to applets what an OS is to Programs.

  The tasks executed by LaunchMenu are similar to those executed by an operating system, is kept similarly flexible. Applets are

  User32.createWindow() ==> createMenuItem()

  So instead of forcing you to provide data and LaunchMenu's API taking care of all the presentation, you create the presentation yourself using LaunchMenu building blocks
