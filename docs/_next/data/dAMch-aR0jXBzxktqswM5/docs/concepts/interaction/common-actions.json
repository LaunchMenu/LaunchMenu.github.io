things like reading settings or opening UI.</p><p>These executables can optionally return <a href=\"/docs/concepts/interaction/undo-redo#commands\" class=\"css-0\">commands</a>. These commands will automatically be executed and are undoable by the user. If multiple items are selected, and multiple commands are obtained, all these commands are combined. This means that the user can undo and redo them all at once.</p><p>The executables can also indicate to be <style data-emotion=\"css an0xih\">.css-an0xih{display:inline-block;background-color:#EEEEEE;word-break:break-word;}</style><code class=\"css-an0xih\">passive</code>. This is used by the context menu to decide when the menu should be closed. When a sub-menu is opened, the main context menu should also remain opened. So opening of UI like this indicates it was a passive executable. But for most of the other executables the context menu should automatically close when they are preformed, so those aren&#x27;t passive. By default executables will be considered as non-passive.

This is what the <a href=\"/docs/concepts/ui/menuitems#folder-menu-items\" class=\"css-0\"><style data-emotion=\"css an0xih\">.css-an0xih{display:inline-block;background-color:#EEEEEE;word-break:break-word;}</style><code class=\"css-an0xih\">createFolderMenuItem</code></a> use for their primary function. This action allows for opening of multiple menus at once when multiple bindings for this action are present on the selection. When multiple menus are opened, the items of all menus are merged into one list of items, and the menus names are also merged into one comma separated name.</p><p>As discussed in the main description of the <a href=\"#executeAction\" class=\"css-0\"><style data-emotion=\"css an0xih\">.css-an0xih{display:inline-block;background-color:#EEEEEE;word-break:break-word;}</style><code class=\"css-an0xih\">executeAction</code></a> execution callbacks can indicate whether they are passive. Bindings of the <style data-emotion=\"css an0xih\">.css-an0xih{display:inline-block;background-color:#EEEEEE;word-break:break-word;}</style><code class=\"css-an0xih\">openMenuExecuteHandler</code> can indicate that the menu should be closed when a non-passive item selection is executed. The executable of <style data-emotion=\"css an0xih\">.css-an0xih{display:inline-block;background-color:#EEEEEE;word-break:break-word;}</style><code class=\"css-an0xih\">openMenuExecuteHandler</code> resolves once the opened menu is closed, and whether it&#x27;s passive depends on whether it was closed by executing such a selection with <strong>only</strong> non-passive items. If the menu was exited in any other way, the <style data-emotion=\"css an0xih\">.css-an0xih{display:inline-block;background-color:#EEEEEE;word-break:break-word;}</style><code class=\"css-an0xih\">openMenuExecuteHandler</code> is considered to have been passive, as it didn&#x27;t close as a result of only non-passive actions. All of this is rather confusing, and fortunately something you generally don&#x27;t have to worry about, but it&#x27;s quite critical for intuitive navigation within nested menus in the context-menu.</p><p>Below is the exact interface of data that can be passed to bindings of the <style data-emotion=\"css

nn640c\">.css-nn640c{-webkit-text-decoration:none;text-decoration:none;color:inherit;}</style><a href=\"#item-overrides\" class=\"css-nn640c\"><h3>Item overrides</h3></a><p>Since actions can be specialized, it makes sense to allow the context-items that represent these items to be specializeable too. We&#x27;ve already shown a short example of this in the <a href=\"#custom-execute-handler\" class=\"css-0\">custom execute handler section</a>. We perform this kind of &#x27;item specialization&#x27; using action overrides.</p><p>When a <style data-emotion=\"css an0xih\">.css-an0xih{display:inline-block;background-color:#EEEEEE;word-break:break-word;}</style><code class=\"css-an0xih\">contextMenuAction</code> binding is created, you can indicate what action&#x27;s menu item should be overridden. I.e. an action <style data-emotion=\"css an0xih\">.css-an0xih{display:inline-block;background-color:#EEEEEE;word-break:break-word;}</style><code class=\"css-an0xih\">B</code> can indicate to be an context-menu override of action <style data-emotion=\"css an0xih\">.css-an0xih{display:inline-block;background-color:#EEEEEE;word-break:break-word;}</style><code class=\"css-an0xih\">A</code>. Then whenever all bindings for action <style data-emotion=\"css an0xih\">.css-an0xih{display:inline-block;background-color:#EEEEEE;word-break:break-word;}</style><code class=\"css-an0xih\">A</code> happen to come either directly or indirectly from action <style data-emotion=\"css an0xih\">.css-an0xih{display:inline-block;background-color:#EEEEEE;word-break:break-word;}</style><code class=\"css-an0xih\">B</code>, the item of action <style data-emotion=\"css an0xih\">.css-an0xih{display:inline-block;background-color:#EEEEEE;word-break:break-word;}</style><code class=\"css-an0xih\">B</code> will be displayed instead of the one from action <style data-emotion=\"css an0xih\">.css-an0xih{display:inline-block;background-color:#EEEEEE;word-break:break-word;}</style><code class=\"css-an0xih\">A</code>. The actual <style data-emotion=\"css an0xih\">.css-an0xih{display:inline-block;background-color:#EEEEEE;word-break:break-word;}</style><code class=\"css-an0xih\">execute</code> from item <style data-emotion=\"css an0xih\">.css-an0xih{display:inline-block;background-color:#EEEEEE;word-break:break-word;}</style><code class=\"css-an0xih\">A</code> will still be used however, usually resulting in only visuals being affected.</p><p>The specifics are quite difficult to grasp, so let&#x27;s consider a couple of examples. In the graphs below, an arrow from <style data-emotion=\"css an0xih\">.css-an0xih{display:inline-block;background-color:#EEEEEE;word-break:break-word;}</style><code class=\"css-an0xih\">A</code> to <style data-emotion=\"css an0xih\">.css-an0xih{display:inline-block;background-color:#EEEEEE;word-break:break-word;}</style><code class=\"css-an0xih\">B</code> represents that <style data-emotion=\"css an0xih\">.css-an0xih{display:inline-block;background-color:#EEEEEE;word-break:break-word;}</style><code class=\"css-an0xih\">A</code> is a handler of <style data-emotion=\"css an0xih\">.css-an0xih{display:inline-block;background-color:#EEEEEE;word-break:break-word;}</style><code class=\"css-an0xih\">B</code>. Imagine a action specialization graph as indicated below:</p><style data-emotion=\"css 1x06cmw\">.css-1x06cmw{box-shadow:0px 0px 30px -5px rgba(0,0,0,0.3);border-radius:10px;overflow:hidden;margin-bottom:8px;}.css-1x06cmw .linenumber{min-width:30px!important;color:#AAA!important;}.css-1x06cmw span{word-break:break-all;}</style><div class=\"css-1x06cmw\"><code class=\"language-text undefined\" style=\"color:#393A34;font-family:&quot;Consolas&quot;, &quot;Bitstream Vera Sans Mono&quot;, &quot;Courier New&quot;, Courier, monospace;direction:ltr;text-align:left;white-space:pre-wrap;word-spacing:normal;word-break:normal;font-size:11px;line-height:14px;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;-webkit-hyphens:none;-moz-hyphens:none;-ms-hyphens:none;hyphens:none;display:block;background-color:#FAFAFA;padding:8px\"><span style=\"flex-wrap:wrap\"><span>   ┌─&gt;A&lt;─┐\n</span></span><span style=\"flex-wrap:wrap\">   │     │\n</span><span style=\"flex-wrap:wrap\">   B&lt;─┬─&gt;C&lt;─┐\n</span><span style=\"flex-wrap:wrap\">      │     │\n</span><span style=\"flex-wrap:wrap\">      D     E\n</span></code></div><p>Here <style data-emotion=\"css an0xih\">.css-an0xih{display:inline-block;background-color:#EEEEEE;word-break:break-word;}</style><code class=\"css-an0xih\">A</code> is our initial action, which will show up in the context-menu. For this example, all other actions in the graph also create their own context-menu item, but all specify <style data-emotion=\"css an0xih\">.css-an0xih{display:inline-block;background-color:#EEEEEE;word-break:break-word;}</style><code class=\"css-an0xih\">override:&nbsp;A</code>. Overall, the menu will always show the most specialized item that applies to all of the provided bindings.\nWe will consider a couple of different situations to explore this. In each of these situations the list of letters indicates a collection of bindings for which we open the context menu, followed by the menu item that will be shown in that situation. So for instance when we say <style data-emotion=\"css an0xih\">.css-an0xih{display:inline-block;background-color:#EEEEEE;word-break:break-word;}</style><code class=\"css-an0xih\">[A,&nbsp;D]:&nbsp;A</code>, this means that if we have a selection of items of which 1 item contains a binding for <style data-emotion=\"css an0xih\">.css-an0xih{display:inline-block;background-color:#EEEEEE;word-break:break-word;}</style><code class=\"css-an0xih\">A</code> and 1 contains a binding for <style data-emotion=\"css an0xih\">.css-an0xih{display:inline-block;background-color:#EEEEEE;word-break:break-word;}</style><code class=\"css-an0xih\">B</code>, then we will see the item as defined by <style data-emotion=\"css an0xih\">.css-an0xih{display:inline-block;background-color:#EEEEEE;word-break:break-word;}</style><code class=\"css-an0xih\">A</code> in the context-menu. Here are a couple of situations and how they will work out:</p><style data-emotion=\"css 1x06cmw\">.css-1x06cmw{box-shadow:0px 0px 30px -5px rgba(0,0,0,0.3);border-radius:10px;overflow:hidden;margin-bottom:8px;}.css-1x06cmw .linenumber{min-width:30px!important;color:#AAA!important;}.css-1x06cmw span{word-break:break-all;}</style><div

class=\"css-an0xih\">[B,&nbsp;D]</code> for instance results in an item from <style data-emotion=\"css

When the selection also includes <style data-emotion=\"css an0xih\">.css-an0xih{display:inline-block;background-color:#EEEEEE;word-break:break-word;}</style><code class=\"css-an0xih\">Hallo!</code>, the context-menu item will become <style data-emotion=\"css an0xih\">.css-an0xih{display:inline-block;background-color:#EEEEEE;word-break:break-word;}</style><code class=\"css-an0xih\">&#34;Alert&nbsp;all&#34;</code> once again, since that&#x27;s the most specialized action that describes all bindings.</p><p>This behavior works the same way when manually creating bindings for the <style data-emotion=\"css an0xih\">.css-an0xih{display:inline-block;background-color:#EEEEEE;word-break:break-word;}</style><code class=\"css-an0xih\">contextMenuAction</code>. But as discussed before, for this to work properly you will have to separate the item creation from the execute binding creation.</p></section><section><style data-emotion=\"css nn640c\">.css-nn640c{-webkit-text-decoration:none;text-decoration:none;color:inherit;}</style><a href=\"#context-folder-handler\" class=\"css-nn640c\"><h3>Context folder handler</h3></a><p>When creating a binding for the <style data-emotion=\"css an0xih\">.css-an0xih{display:inline-block;background-color:#EEEEEE;word-break:break-word;}</style><code class=\"css-an0xih\">contextMenuAction</code> any item can be specified. So this includes folder items, meaning that any action can add folders to the context-menu. In some cases this isn&#x27;t exactly what you want however, since it doesn&#x27;t allow other actions to collectively create 1 folder. The global folder in the context-menu is a good example of this, since we want different independent applets to be able to add to this folder.</p><p>This is why we&#x27;ve created yet another action factory similar to the <style data-emotion=\"css an0xih\">.css-an0xih{display:inline-block;background-color:#EEEEEE;word-break:break-word;}</style><code class=\"css-an0xih\">createAction</code> and <style data-emotion=\"css an0xih\">.css-an0xih{display:inline-block;background-color:#EEEEEE;word-break:break-word;}</style><code class=\"css-an0xih\">createContextAction</code> factory functions, except more specific: <style data-emotion=\"css an0xih\">.css-an0xih{display:inline-block;background-color:#EEEEEE;word-break:break-word;}</style><code class=\"css-an0xih\">createContextFolderHandler</code>. This factory creates an action that can serve as a folder for the context-menu. All bindings to an action like this will make sure that this action adds itself as a folder to the context-menu, and all its bindings as children of this action.</p><p>So when you want to create an item that shows in such a context-menu folder rather than the context-menu directly, you can just create a binding to the folder rather than the context-menu. These folder actions accept data with the exact same interface as the <style data-emotion=\"css an0xih\">.css-an0xih{display:inline-block;background-color:#EEEEEE;word-break:break-word;}</style><code class=\"css-an0xih\">contextMenuAction</code> does. What&#x27;s more, the <style data-emotion=\"css an0xih\">.css-an0xih{display:inline-block;background-color:#EEEEEE;word-break:break-word;}</style><code class=\"css-an0xih\">createContextAction</code> accepts an optional property that specifies the folder to put the item in.</p><p>This <style data-emotion=\"css an0xih\">.css-an0xih{display:inline-block;background-color:#EEEEEE;word-break:break-word;}</style><code class=\"css-an0xih\">createContextFolderHandler</code> even allows you to specify the parent action - which defaults to the <style data-emotion=\"css an0xih\">.css-an0xih{display:inline-block;background-color:#EEEEEE;word-break:break-word;}</style><code class=\"css-an0xih\">contextmenuAction</code> - such that you can create nested menus.\nThe example below shows off how a menu and even a nested menu can easily be created:</p><style data-emotion=\"css 1x06cmw\">.css-1x06cmw{box-shadow:0px 0px 30px -5px rgba(0,0,0,0.3);border-radius:10px;overflow:hidden;margin-bottom:8px;}.css-1x06cmw .linenumber{min-width:30px!important;color:#AAA!important;}.css-1x06cmw span{word-break:break-all;}</style><div metastring=\"title=src/index.tsx source=https://github.com/LaunchMenu/LM-applet-examples/tree/main/examples/commonActionsContextMenuFolders video=https://raw.github.com/LaunchMenu/LM-applet-examples/main/examples/commonActionsContextMenuFolders/recordings/demo.webm\" class=\"css-1x06cmw\"><style data-emotion=\"css 1rf12ws\">.css-1rf12ws{display:-webkit-box;display:-webkit-flex;display:-ms-flexbox;display:flex;-webkit-align-items:center;-webkit-box-align:center;-ms-flex-align:center;align-items:center;-webkit-box-flex-wrap:wrap;-webkit-flex-wrap:wrap;-ms-flex-wrap:wrap;flex-wrap:wrap;background-color:#EEEEEE;}.css-1rf12ws .MuiButtonBase-root{padding:8px;border-radius:50%;}</style><div class=\"css-1rf12ws\"><style data-emotion=\"css 1iuj5ih\">.css-1iuj5ih{padding-left:8px;}</style><div class=\"css-1iuj5ih\">src/index.tsx</div><style data-emotion=\"css nn640c\">.css-nn640c{-webkit-text-decoration:none;text-decoration:none;color:inherit;}</style><a href=\"https://github.com/LaunchMenu/LM-applet-examples/tree/main/examples/commonActionsContextMenuFolders\" class=\"css-nn640c\"><button class=\"MuiButtonBase-root MuiIconButton-root\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\" aria-label=\"view source\" title=\"View source\"><span class=\"MuiIconButton-label\"><svg class=\"MuiSvgIcon-root\" focusable=\"false\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><path d=\"M12 .3a12 12 0 0 0-3.8 23.4c.6.1.8-.3.8-.6v-2c-3.3.7-4-1.6-4-1.6-.6-1.4-1.4-1.8-1.4-1.8-1-.7.1-.7.1-.7 1.2 0 1.9 1.2 1.9 1.2 1 1.8 2.8 1.3 3.5 1 0-.8.4-1.3.7-1.6-2.7-.3-5.5-1.3-5.5-6 0-1.2.5-2.3 1.3-3.1-.2-.4-.6-1.6 0-3.2 0 0 1-.3 3.4 1.2a11.5 11.5 0 0 1 6 0c2.3-1.5 3.3-1.2 3.3-1.2.6 1.6.2 2.8 0 3.2.9.8 1.3 1.9 1.3 3.2 0 4.6-2.8 5.6-5.5 5.9.5.4.9 1 .9 2.2v3.3c0 .3.1.7.8.6A12 12 0 0 0 12 .3\"></path></svg></span></button></a><div class=\"MuiBox-root jss47\"></div><button class=\"MuiButtonBase-root MuiIconButton-root\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\" aria-label=\"Show demo\" title=\"Show demo\"><span class=\"MuiIconButton-label\"><svg class=\"MuiSvgIcon-root\" focusable=\"false\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><path d=\"M8 5v14l11-7z\"></path></svg></span></button><button class=\"MuiButtonBase-root MuiIconButton-root\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\" aria-label=\"Copy code to clipboard\" title=\"Copy code\"><span class=\"MuiIconButton-label\"><svg class=\"MuiSvgIcon-root\" focusable=\"false\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><path d=\"M3 5H1v16c0 1.1.9 2 2 2h16v-2H3V5zm18-4H7c-1.1 0-2 .9-2 2v14c0 1.1.9 2 2 2h14c1.1 0 2-.9 2-2V3c0-1.1-.9-2-2-2zm0 16H7V3h14v14z\"></path></svg></span></button><button class=\"MuiButtonBase-root MuiIconButton-root\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\" aria-label=\"Toggle line numbers\" title=\"Toggle line numbers\"><span class=\"MuiIconButton-label\"><svg class=\"MuiSvgIcon-root\" focusable=\"false\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><path d=\"M2 17h2v.5H3v1h1v.5H2v1h3v-4H2v1zm1-9h1V4H2v1h1v3zm-1 3h1.8L2 13.1v.9h3v-1H3.2L5 10.9V10H2v1zm5-6v2h14V5H7zm0 14h14v-2H7v2zm0-6h14v-2H7v2z\"></path></svg></span></button><style data-emotion=\"css 1739oy8\">.css-1739oy8{z-index:1;}</style><div class=\"MuiBackdrop-root css-1739oy8\" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"opacity:0;visibility:hidden\"><div><style data-emotion=\"css 1vrs79m\">.css-1vrs79m{border:2px solid #EEEEEE;width:100%;max-width:100%;}</style><div class=\"MuiBox-root jss48 css-1vrs79m\"><style data-emotion=\"css qhzqsw\">.css-qhzqsw{max-width:100%;width:100%;display:block;}</style><video class=\"css-qhzqsw\"><source src=\"https://raw.github.com/LaunchMenu/LM-applet-examples/main/examples/commonActionsContextMenuFolders/recordings/demo.webm\" type=\"video/mp4\"/><p>Your browser doesn&#x27;t support HTML5 video.

The preferred way of creating shortcuts is by adding it to properties from the <style data-emotion=\"css an0xih\">.css-an0xih{display:inline-block;background-color:#EEEEEE;word-break:break-word;}</style><code class=\"css-an0xih\">createStandardMenuItem</code> factory, since it will make sure that the shortcut is visible on the item and displayed to the user. This function also receives the <style data-emotion=\"css an0xih\">.css-an0xih{display:inline-block;background-color:#EEEEEE;word-break:break-word;}</style><code class=\"css-an0xih\">IOContext</code> like the other two, so settings could be used here too. The second item shows off that the execution of the shortcut doesn&#x27;t have to be the same as the primary execution of the item. In most cases you do want these to be equivalent however, which is why you can link them using the unique <style data-emotion=\"css an0xih\">.css-an0xih{display:inline-block;background-color:#EEEEEE;word-break:break-word;}</style><code class=\"css-an0xih\">itemID</code>.

This is used to obtain a collection of items that satisfy a search according to a given menu item. You can learn more about the search system as well as little bit about the search action on the <a href=\"/docs/concepts/interaction/search-system\" class=\"css-0\">search system page</a>.</p><section><style data-emotion=\"css nn640c\">.css-nn640c{-webkit-text-decoration:none;text-decoration:none;color:inherit;}</style><a href=\"#identity-action\" class=\"css-nn640c\"><h3>Identity action</h3></a><p>Action bindings are independent of one and another, and when getting the content of an action it&#x27;s generally not possible to find what item a binding corresponded to. But in some cases (such as the search action) you do need to have access to the entire item, and not only the binding data.</p><p>One could add the entire item reference within the binding in order to fix this, but this will make menu items less flexible. We can currently for instance rather easily augment a menu item by simply copying it and adding an extra binding to the copy. This doesn&#x27;t interfere with the original item, but does leave us with a specialized item. This would however not work as intended if the search action binding contained a reference to the original item, since then the search action will find copies of the original when searching in our augmented item, rather than our augmented version itself.</p><p>The <style data-emotion=\"css an0xih\">.css-an0xih{display:inline-block;background-color:#EEEEEE;word-break:break-word;}</style><code class=\"css-an0xih\">identityAction</code> tries to fix this problem by making a dedicated action that labels an item with a randomly generated identification code (UUID). An action search as the search action can then then use that same UUID in its binding, and find the item to return from the search based on this ID and the collection of menu items that the search was executed on. Then when we want to extend this action, we only have to replace this identity binding with a newly updated binding, rather than having to replace any number of arbitrary actions that may rely on the item&#x27;s identity.</p><p>The <style data-emotion=\"css an0xih\">.css-an0xih{display:inline-block;background-color:#EEEEEE;word-break:break-word;}</style><code class=\"css-an0xih\">menuItemIdentityAction</code> is a handler for the <style data-emotion=\"css an0xih\">.css-an0xih{display:inline-block;background-color:#EEEEEE;word-break:break-word;}</style><code class=\"css-an0xih\">identityAction</code> which specializes the scenario to menu items, rather than just any possible action targets. The <style data-emotion=\"css an0xih\">.css-an0xih{display:inline-block;background-color:#EEEEEE;word-break:break-word;}</style><code class=\"css-an0xih\">menuItemIdentityAction</code> is the exact action that the search action handlers use, since we must be sure that the result returns menu items rather than just any action targets.
