But in the end you can see how these aspects come together in common actions for menu items. The <a href=\"#justification\" class=\"css-0\">justification section</a> can already give you a slight background in why some of this functionality is desirable.</p><p>In its most basic form, actions can be seen as a way of extracting data satisfying a given interface from a collection of items. These items can be anything, but are typically menu items.</p><p>We can for instance have an &#x27;interface&#x27; for names of items:</p><style data-emotion=\"css 1x06cmw\">.css-1x06cmw{box-shadow:0px 0px 30px -5px rgba(0,0,0,0.3);border-radius:10px;overflow:hidden;margin-bottom:8px;}.css-1x06cmw .linenumber{min-width:30px!important;color:#AAA!important;}.css-1x06cmw span{word-break:break-all;}</style><div metastring=\"title=actionDeclaration.ts\" class=\"css-1x06cmw\"><style data-emotion=\"css 1rf12ws\">.css-1rf12ws{display:-webkit-box;display:-webkit-flex;display:-ms-flexbox;display:flex;-webkit-align-items:center;-webkit-box-align:center;-ms-flex-align:center;align-items:center;-webkit-box-flex-wrap:wrap;-webkit-flex-wrap:wrap;-ms-flex-wrap:wrap;flex-wrap:wrap;background-color:#EEEEEE;}.css-1rf12ws .MuiButtonBase-root{padding:8px;border-radius:50%;}</style><div class=\"css-1rf12ws\"><style data-emotion=\"css 1iuj5ih\">.css-1iuj5ih{padding-left:8px;}</style><div class=\"css-1iuj5ih\">actionDeclaration.ts</div><div class=\"MuiBox-root jss14\"></div><button class=\"MuiButtonBase-root MuiIconButton-root\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\" aria-label=\"Copy code to clipboard\" title=\"Copy code\"><span class=\"MuiIconButton-label\"><svg class=\"MuiSvgIcon-root\" focusable=\"false\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><path d=\"M3 5H1v16c0 1.1.9 2 2 2h16v-2H3V5zm18-4H7c-1.1 0-2 .9-2 2v14c0 1.1.9 2 2 2h14c1.1 0 2-.9 2-2V3c0-1.1-.9-2-2-2zm0 16H7V3h14v14z\"></path></svg></span></button><button class=\"MuiButtonBase-root MuiIconButton-root\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\" aria-label=\"Toggle line numbers\" title=\"Toggle line numbers\"><span class=\"MuiIconButton-label\"><svg class=\"MuiSvgIcon-root\" focusable=\"false\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><path d=\"M2 17h2v.5H3v1h1v.5H2v1h3v-4H2v1zm1-9h1V4H2v1h1v3zm-1 3h1.8L2 13.1v.9h3v-1H3.2L5 10.9V10H2v1zm5-6v2h14V5H7zm0 14h14v-2H7v2zm0-6h14v-2H7v2z\"></path></svg></span></button><style data-emotion=\"css 1739oy8\">.css-1739oy8{z-index:1;}</style><div class=\"MuiBackdrop-root css-1739oy8\" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"opacity:0;visibility:hidden\"><div></div></div></div><code class=\"language-ts undefined\" style=\"color:#393A34;font-family:&quot;Consolas&quot;, &quot;Bitstream Vera Sans Mono&quot;, &quot;Courier New&quot;, Courier, monospace;direction:ltr;text-align:left;white-space:pre-wrap;word-spacing:normal;word-break:normal;font-size:11px;line-height:14px;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;-webkit-hyphens:none;-moz-hyphens:none;-ms-hyphens:none;hyphens:none;display:block;background-color:#FAFAFA;padding:8px\"><span style=\"flex-wrap:wrap\"><span class=\"token\" style=\"color:#0000ff\">const</span><span> names </span><span class=\"token\" style=\"color:#393A34\">=</span><span> </span><span class=\"token\" style=\"color:#393A34\">createAction</span><span class=\"token\" style=\"color:#393A34\">(</span><span class=\"token\" style=\"color:#393A34\">{</span><span>\n</span></span><span style=\"flex-wrap:wrap\"><span>    name</span><span class=\"token\" style=\"color:#393A34\">:</span><span> </span><span class=\"token\" style=\"color:#A31515\">&quot;names&quot;</span><span class=\"token\" style=\"color:#393A34\">,</span><span>\n</span></span><span style=\"flex-wrap:wrap\"><span>    </span><span class=\"token function-variable\" style=\"color:#393A34\">core</span><span class=\"token\" style=\"color:#393A34\">:</span><span> </span><span class=\"token\" style=\"color:#393A34\">(</span><span>names</span><span class=\"token\" style=\"color:#393A34\">:</span><span> </span><span class=\"token builtin\">string</span><span class=\"token\" style=\"color:#393A34\">[</span><span class=\"token\" style=\"color:#393A34\">]</span><span class=\"token\" style=\"color:#393A34\">)</span><span> </span><span class=\"token arrow\" style=\"color:#393A34\">=&gt;</span><span> </span><span class=\"token\" style=\"color:#393A34\">(</span><span class=\"token\" style=\"color:#393A34\">{</span><span>result</span><span class=\"token\" style=\"color:#393A34\">:</span><span> names</span><span class=\"token\" style=\"color:#393A34\">}</span><span class=\"token\" style=\"color:#393A34\">)</span><span class=\"token\" style=\"color:#393A34\">,</span><span>\n</span></span><span style=\"flex-wrap:wrap\"><span></span><span class=\"token\" style=\"color:#393A34\">}</span><span class=\"token\" style=\"color:#393A34\">)</span><span class=\"token\" style=\"color:#393A34\">;</span></span></code></div><p>When we create an action, we must provide a name for it.

correct result for a given action is rather complex.\nIt involves:</p><ul><li>Going through all items and their action bindings</li><li>Mapping out the static action graph</li><li>Determining a sequence of executing the required handlers</li><li>Executing the actions in this sequence, to arrive at the final result</li></ul><p>Because of this, the system is relatively slow and has a lot of overhead. In some cases where efficiency is important, this system should be avoided.\nIn some of these situations where efficiency is important, it could still be used however. If you will make multiple repeated calls, but these calls are all on the same data, the action system will pose minimal overhead since the structure is only used once.</p><section><style

an0xih\">.css-an0xih{display:inline-block;background-color:#EEEEEE;word-break:break-word;}</style><code class=\"css-an0xih\">.createBinding</code> method isn&#x27;t really required. This style of declaration however can&#x27;t perform type checking. If we specified <style data-emotion=\"css an0xih\">.css-an0xih{display:inline-block;background-color:#EEEEEE;word-break:break-word;}</style><code class=\"css-an0xih\">data:&nbsp;3</code>, we would get no compile time error, only possibly a runtime error or otherwise unexpected behavior. So making use of <style data-emotion=\"css an0xih\">.css-an0xih{display:inline-block;background-color:#EEEEEE;word-break:break-word;}</style><code class=\"css-an0xih\">.createBinding</code> on actions is generally a lot safer, and also a bit more convenient in my opinion.</p><p>The <style data-emotion=\"css an0xih\">.css-an0xih{display:inline-block;background-color:#EEEEEE;word-break:break-word;}</style><code class=\"css-an0xih\">extras</code> property can just be used to provide some extra functionality for your action.
