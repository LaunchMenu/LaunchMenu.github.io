# Snippets

<StatusNotice />

## Roadmap

The exact features of this applet haven't been determined yet, but it will generally just provide automatic snippet insertion.

The user would be able to configure that a given piece of text is mapped to some other given piee of text.
`:D` could for instance be mapped to `ðŸ˜„`. Then when the applet is enabled, when `:D` is typed in any program, it will automatically be replaced with the unicode `ðŸ˜„` text.

### Technical details

This applet would require to actively listen to all keypresses of the user when the applet is enabled. We will have to look into how feasible this is (in a stable way without interfearing with normal OS keyboard usage) for all of the supported OSes.
