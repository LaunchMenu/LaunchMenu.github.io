# Translator

<StatusNotice />

## Roadmap

The exact features of this applet haven't been determined yet, but it will generally just provide simple quick translation results.

This could be provided by using a specific search pattern, such as:

```
en-nl: I like nuts
```

which would translate `I like nuts` from English to Dutch.

### API

We would need to find a free, credentialless API that would allow for translation, which may be challenging if not impossible. LaunchMenu doesn't have a back-end in which it can securely hide credentials however, so if this isn't feasible we might need to find another way to achieve this.
